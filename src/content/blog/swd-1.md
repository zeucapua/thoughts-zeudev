## Elements, Tags, and the Properties Within

HTML is the programming language used to layout the content inside a webpage. Writing in HTML involves using
elements, also known as tags (throughout the series, I will be using these interchangebly), and putting them in order 
depending on your design.

Most tags are used in twos, both with angle brackets with the type inside, with the ending tag's type starting 
with a slash. Between the two is where we'd put content, which can also include more elements.

Some elements, like `<img />`, are what's called "self-closing tags", denoted with the slash at the end. We can
configure tags like these with its properties, or "props" for short. For example, to have this image tag to show a 
picture, we'll set its `src` property a link, as well as state an alternate text to make it accessible to those
hard of seeing.

## So Common You Should Memorize Them 

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), a definitive web development resource online, has a list of all HTML tags. All in
all, there are 142 elements, 115 of which are functional today with the rest being deprecated.
